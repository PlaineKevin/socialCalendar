I worked with miles
Currently it is more like a personal calendar with the potential for easy extension into shared cloud calendars
Users can make edits if they are on the same account but not if they are just friends.

Implementation:
	13 scenes from view controllers, navigation controllers, tab bar view controller, regular views, table view controllers, table views
	tab bar view controller that lets us select between calendar view, friends list, and events
	log in is implemented with Parse
	We also use Parse to create personalized accounts(for friends, events, and calendar)
	We use Parse to store all of our information
	CoreData was implemented(most of the code is just commented out but ideally would work with 10 minutes of tweaking)
	ImageViews as well as default pictures
	Dates are implemented with DatePickers
	3rd party calendar view
